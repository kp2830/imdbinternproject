# 🎬 IMDb Intern Project

This is a responsive movie browsing web app built using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. It fetches live movie data from the TMDB API and displays trending, top-rated, and individual movie or actor details. The homepage features a smooth, animated horizontal carousel of trending movies with autoplay, drag functionality, arrows, and dots for navigation.
